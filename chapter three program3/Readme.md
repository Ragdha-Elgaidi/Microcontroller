- Design a PIC 16f877A program to control an automatic garage, where the allowed number of cars in the garage is 9 cars.
-  The number of the cars in the garage is displayed on seven segments. 
-  If one car entered the garage, the 7-segment increased and if one car leaved the garage the 7-segment decreased. 
-  The garage has two gates, one for entry and the other for exit, where these gates open and close
   automatically as soon as the cars arrive at it. 
- If the garage is completed, the entry gate does not open for any car and turn on red led as alarm. The following figure
  shows the entry gate. The figure of the exit gate as the entry gate except for the
  alarm led.
- Suppose the appropriate input and output devices for this project.
