Write a PIC 16f877A program to control traffic light sign as shown in the
following figure, where each sign consists of green, yellow, and red lamps.
the following control sequence which is initiated just after pressing start

• Step1: the green1 and red2 lamps turn on for 10 seconds.
• Step2: the green1, yellow1, red2 and yellow 2 lamps turn on for 3 seconds.
• Step3: the red1 and green2 lamps turn on for 10 seconds.
• Step4: the red1, yellow1, green2 and yellow2 lamps turn on for 3 seconds.
• Step5: return to step1 and repeating the control loop.
Draw the required interfacing circuit for this project.
