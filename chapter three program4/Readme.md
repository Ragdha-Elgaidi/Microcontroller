- Write a PIC 16f877A program to control digital traffic light system as shown in thefollowing figure, where each sign consists of green and red lamps and sevensegments. The following control sequence which is initiated just after pressing start
pushbutton and terminates just pressing stop pushbutton:
-  Step1: the green1 and red2 lamps turn on and hence each seven segment counts
descending from 9 to 0 with time delay 2 sec between each two numbers.
- Step2: after the two seven segments reach to zero, the red1 and green2 lamps turn
on and hence each seven segment counts descending from 9 to 0 with time delay 2
sec between each two numbers.
- Step3: return to step1 and repeating the control loop.
Draw the required interfacing circuit for this project.
